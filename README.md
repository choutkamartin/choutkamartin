### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Martin. A full-stack developer. I use **JavaScript** (**TypeScript**) mainly, that's why I use **Node.js**, **Express** as a framework, **MongoDB**, **React** or **Next.js**. 

I'm also open to using C#, SQL and more. I translate applications such as [Bouncer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission) or [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). 

I used to do 3D models and drawings related to engineering. Check out my profile on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/martin.choutka-1).

If you wish to contact me you can do so via e-mail: [email@martinchoutka.cz](mailto:email@martinchoutka.cz)

Have a great day!

#### Pro tip
> Always check the capitalization of your imports. If the capitalization is wrong, then:

> - Linux will have a seizure

> Might save you the wondering why Docker image won't build correctly
